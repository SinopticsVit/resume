# Getting Started with Serverless Stack (SST)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Serverless Stack](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/packages/create-serverless-stack).

Start by installing the dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Commands

### `npm run start`

Starts the local Lambda development environment.

### `npm run build`

Build your app and synthesize your stacks.

Generates a `.build/` directory with the compiled files and a `.build/cdk.out/` directory with the synthesized CloudFormation stacks.

### `npm run deploy [stack]`

Deploy all your stacks to AWS. Or optionally deploy, a specific stack.

### `npm run remove [stack]`

Remove all your stacks and all of their resources from AWS. Or optionally removes, a specific stack.

### `npm run test`

Runs your tests using Jest. Takes all the [Jest CLI options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli).

## 3. Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph iac [IaC]
    CFN[CloudFormation_SAM_or_CDK]
    PUL[Pulumi_Terraform]
  end
  subgraph cloud [Cloud_Account]
    VPC[VPC_Subnets]
    IAM[IAM_Roles]

  end
  CFN --> VPC
  PUL --> cloud
```

- **Inbound:** HTTP (API Gateway / ALB), scheduled triggers, queues (SQS/SNS), EventBridge rules, or batch — infer from `stacks/`, `template.yaml`, `sst.config.ts`, or `src/` handlers.
- **Outbound:** databases and external HTTP APIs per layers and `package.json` / Python imports in handlers.
- **IaC pattern:** SST/CDK, SAM/CloudFormation, Pulumi, Helm, Terraform, or raw scripts — see manifests section.

## 4. Key files (auto-discovered)

## 6. Notable patterns / snippets


**`stacks/index.js`**

```text
import CoreStack from "./CoreStack";

export default function main(app) {

    new CoreStack(app, "sst-stack");

    // Add more stacks
}
```


## 7. Metrics / SLO / scale (if available)

_Extract from Airflow DAG params, load tests, README, or CloudFormation `ReservedConcurrentExecutions` when present — not auto-inferred to avoid fabrication._

## 8. Resume bullets (ready-to-paste, English)

- Owned or extended **`botnot-env-rds-res`** capabilities aligned with **infra** delivery.
- Applied **JavaScript** stack patterns and repository-local IaC/config where present.
- Collaborated on production-grade defaults: structured logging, retries, and least-privilege IAM patterns where applicable.
- Integrated with **Yofi** platform services (data stores, queues, gateways) per dependency manifests in-repo.
- Documented operational expectations (deploy, test, local dev) via README and automation files when available.

## 9. Interview talking points

- What is the main entrypoint and trigger for `botnot-env-rds-res`?
- How are secrets and non-prod environments separated?
- What failure modes are handled (retries, DLQ, idempotency)?
- How would you observe this service in production (metrics, logs, traces)?

# yofi-realtime-severity-engine

**Path:** `D:/botnot/yofi-realtime-severity-engine`  
**Category:** ml-bot-detection  
**Primary language:** Unknown  
**Status:** present on disk

## 1. Purpose (2-3 lines)

Internal **Yofi** repository `yofi-realtime-severity-engine` under category **ml-bot-detection**. Supports Yofi/Botnot platform capabilities (e-commerce intelligence, anti-fraud adjacent services, data plane, or infrastructure) as evidenced by repository layout and manifests.

## 2. Tech stack (from manifests and file-type mix)

- **Detected primary language:** Unknown
- **Top-level layout:** see listing below.

_No common manifest files found at repository root._

- **Inbound:** HTTP (API Gateway / ALB), scheduled triggers, queues (SQS/SNS), EventBridge rules, or batch — infer from `stacks/`, `template.yaml`, `sst.config.ts`, or `src/` handlers.
- **Outbound:** databases and external HTTP APIs per layers and `package.json` / Python imports in handlers.
- **IaC pattern:** SST/CDK, SAM/CloudFormation, Pulumi, Helm, Terraform, or raw scripts — see manifests section.

_Use commit messages only as hints; corroborate in interviews._

## 6. Notable patterns / snippets

_No snippet candidates matched (handler.py / stack.ts / template.yaml etc.). Expand manually after opening the repo._

## 7. Metrics / SLO / scale (if available)

_Extract from Airflow DAG params, load tests, README, or CloudFormation `ReservedConcurrentExecutions` when present — not auto-inferred to avoid fabrication._

## 8. Resume bullets (ready-to-paste, English)

- Owned or extended **`yofi-realtime-severity-engine`** capabilities aligned with **ml bot detection** delivery.
- Applied **Unknown** stack patterns and repository-local IaC/config where present.
- Collaborated on production-grade defaults: structured logging, retries, and least-privilege IAM patterns where applicable.
- Integrated with **Yofi** platform services (data stores, queues, gateways) per dependency manifests in-repo.
- Documented operational expectations (deploy, test, local dev) via README and automation files when available.

## 9. Interview talking points

- What is the main entrypoint and trigger for `yofi-realtime-severity-engine`?
- How are secrets and non-prod environments separated?
- What failure modes are handled (retries, DLQ, idempotency)?
- How would you observe this service in production (metrics, logs, traces)?
